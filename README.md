# AutoMeet

I'm creating this script to automate my online study in Google Meet. I'm too lazy to do that, but not lazy enough to create this script ;)

What already done:
- Input login credentials
- Login to account
- Choose class to connect according to schedule on each day
- Turn off mic and video in call
- Store timetable and schedule for each day

 TODO:
 - Replace all dumb time.sleep() with something smarter
 - Change schedule every second week (medium priority)
 - Add auto disconnect from calls (low priority)
 - Make code more flexible for unusual cases (more work with elif)

### Help and advices are welcome :)
